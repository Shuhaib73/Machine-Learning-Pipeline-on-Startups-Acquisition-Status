## <br>**‚û≤ Machine Learning Pipeline**:

-- The data preprocessing steps include:

           * Feature Selection: Identifying the relevant features from the raw data that will be used for model training.
           * Handling Missing Data: Imputing or removing missing values to ensure clean training data.
           * Normalization/Standardization: Scaling features to bring them to a similar range and avoid model bias.
           * Categorical Encoding: Encoding categorical variables (e.g., company industry, status) into numerical formats using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

## <br>**‚û≤ Building and Training Model**:
-- The pipeline includes both binary and multiclass classification models, as the startup statuses need to be classified into one of several categories. The steps include:

           * Model Selection: Using suitable classifiers (e.g.Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).
           * Model Training: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets and training models on the training data.
           * Model Evaluation: Evaluating models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, among others.

## <br>**‚û≤ Dockerization**:
-- The entire machine learning pipeline is dockerized, making it portable and easier to deploy in various environments. This involves:

           * Containerizing the model and pipeline using Docker to ensure consistency across different stages of development, testing, and production.

## <br>**‚û≤ CI/CD Automation**:
           * Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are implemented to automate the testing, building, and deployment of the model. This ensures that updates to the model or pipeline are smoothly integrated and deployed without manual intervention.

## <br>**‚û≤ Website Development with Flask**:
-- In addition to model deployment, a Flask-based web application has been developed to interact with the trained model. This web application provides a user-friendly interface to input data, make predictions, and display the results. It communicates with the deployed model through RESTful APIs, ensuring that users can interact with the model in real-time.

## <br>**‚û≤ Database Integration and Model Deployment**:
           * Once the models is trained and evaluated, I deployed the model using Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service), ensuring scalability and easy access for real-time predictions. This setup allows the model to be accessed via APIs for making predictions in real-time, such as determining the status of new startups.

           * To manage and store company and user credentials securely, Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) has been used. RDS provides scalable, managed storage for user data and startup-related information. It ensures that sensitive information is stored securely and can be easily accessed by the deployed application for real-time predictions.
